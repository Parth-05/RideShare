# RideShare/Ride Booking Application
This is a full-stack Ride Booking Application that simulates the core functionality of a ride-hailing service.
It allows customers to book rides by selecting pickup and dropoff locations on a map, and enables drivers to receive ride requests in real time via WebSocket and accept or decline them. Once a driver accepts, the ride is displayed as an ongoing ride for both parties.
